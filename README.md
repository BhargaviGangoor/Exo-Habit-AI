# 🌌 Exoplanet Habitability Prediction — ML Pipeline

This project aims to predict the habitability potential of exoplanets using real NASA datasets.  
So far, the focus has been on collecting, cleaning, and preparing the data for machine learning.

## 🎯 Project Progress (Modules Completed)

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
Datasets were sourced from:
- 🌌 **NASA Exoplanet Archive**
- 📘 **Kaggle**

Key scientific features were selected, such as:
- Planet radius  
- Mass  
- Temperature  
- Orbital period  
- Star temperature  
- Star type  
- Eccentricity  
- Semi-major axis  

---

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Standardization**
Using **Python + Pandas**, the following steps were completed:

- Removed metadata/comment lines (`#`) from NASA CSVs  
- Renamed technical column names → human-readable labels  
- Dropped rows missing critical features  
- Filled other missing values (mean/Unknown)  
- Merged two datasets  
- Removed duplicate entries  

---

## 📊 Final Dataset

- **5585 rows × 9 cleaned features**  
- Fully structured and ready for:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis  
  - Feature engineering  
  - ML model training
